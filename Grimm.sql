CREATE TABLE characteristics (wesen_id int, wesen_name varchar(100), wesen_characteristics varchar (800), foreign key (wesen_id) references wesen(id));

INSERT INTO characteristics (wesen_id, wesen_name, wesen_characteristics) VALUES
(1,"Alpe","'A sleep eating wesen with green eyes that feeds off melatonin, causing its victim severe insomnia.  Alpen are clever, cunning creatures with a bit of an arrogance in the way they carry themselves.'"),
(2,"Anubis","'A jackal creature considered godlike protectors of the dead by ancient Egyptians. They are respectful of artifacts, and are involved with the Beati Paoli, a group of wesen dedicated to preservation of wesen culture.'"),
(3,"Apgadnieks","'A husky like creature with either body that is white, brown, or both, and a nosed dog-like rhinarium.  They have a natural tendency to be leaders, and as such, they aren't hesitant to give orders or directions when necessary. They are also courageous and more than willing to fight others that may be much bigger or older than they are. Additionally, they are clever and quite resourceful.'"),
(4,"Aswang","'A ghoul creature from Filipino mythology. In the series, aswang attack pregnant women with their piercing tongue, injecting a tranquilizer and sucking the infant and amniotic fluid out of the womb. It is a tradition (which some aswang consider barbaric) for the eldest son to give up his first conceived child for his mother's consumption to extend her lifespan.'"),
(5,"Ataktos Fuse","'A cicada-like wesen with yellowish-brown exoskeleton.  They emerge from underground for just twenty four hours once every seven years. During that time, they will try and consume as much protein as they can, while looking for a large enough person to take back underground with them, where they will feed on that individual until they emerge once again in seven years.'"),
(6,"Balam","'A jaguar creature that is closely related to the Yaguaraté.  They have been known to develop obsessive behavior, specifically when it comes to any harm done to members of the Balam's family. They are extremely daring and, at times, aggressive creatures that tend to act first and think later. However, when facing another formidable Wesen, such as a Blutbad, they tend to back off.'"),
(7,"Barbatus Ossifrage","'A Bearded vulture-like creature that preys on the mortally wounded. It breaks its victims' bones and then liquefies them for consumption.'"),
(8,"Bauerschwein","'A pig-like creature that has been in a centuries-old feud with the blutbads.  They are known for being diligent and hard-working and are capable of interacting with humans in this manner. Unfortunately, Bauerschwein are not particularly strong Wesen, and as such, they are noted to be constant victims of the Blutbad.  They also often take mud baths to help ease their minds and think.'"),
(9,"Blutbad","'A wolf-like creature that has been in a centuries-old feud with bauerschweins.  They have a keen sense of smell that is provoked by the color red.  Blutbaden are incredibly strong, more than any man and most Wesen, and have been shown overpowering their adversaries in both human and Wesen form.'"),
(10,"Coyotl","'A coyote-like creature that are known for being mean, nasty, and all around bullies, and they are often considered the equivalent of street gangs in the Wesen world. They have a very strong pack mentality and don't take kindly to anyone straying from the sacred bond of the pack.'"),
(11,"Cracher-Mortel","'A creature like a Puffer fish, that are confident and incredibly dangerous. They have no problems with infecting innocent people with their spit and using them as \"zombie\" slaves. They also have strong ties to Voodoo ceremonies, as they are responsible for inspiring multiple events. They are generally intelligent and cunning, as well as sophisticated and smartly dressed, often wearing a suit and a top hat. They are also very calm and have a sadistic sense of humor.'"),
(12,"Cupiditas","'A cupid-like wesen that collects victims' hair to make amor de infierno \(Spanish: hellish love). Cupiditas are known to be vengeful creatures who can hold grudges for a very long time. If any of their loved ones are wronged in any way, they will avenge them, usually by making the Amor de Infierno. They do not care much for the lives of others outside of their own family and are willing to kill anyone who stands in the way of them achieving their own brand of vindictive justice. Lacking any particular physical prowess in their woged state, they resort to using their intelligence and sneaky, cunning behavior to their advantage.'"),
(13,"Dämonfeuer","'A rare draconic creature with the ability to vaporize their own fat, which they cough up as flammable particles that can ignite.  Dämonfeuer are treasure-mongers, though in modern times, they have abandoned gold and jewels, instead collecting large amounts of copper, of which they are very possessive. They have no qualms with stealing copper to increase their horde.  Due to their might, Dämonfeuer are not afraid of Grimms.'"),
(14,"Dickfellig","'A rhinoceros-like Wesen.  They are superhumanly strong and durable, and they attack by charging at an intended target.'"),
(15,"Drang-Zorn","'A badger-like Wesen.  They are known to have a very short temper and are very easily enraged, and prone to violent outbursts. However, if faced with an adversary that they know they could not prevail over, Drang-Zorns will instead take refuge in underground dens that they built for cases such as these, and they are quite adept at constructing them. Some Drang-Zorns are better tempered than others and have a kinder, more compassionate side, however.  If a Drang-Zorn were to woge before the age of thirteen, they will suffer from a lack of inhibition needed to control their rage and will become homicidal toward anyone who angers them, even towards their own kind.'"),
(16,"Eisbiber","'A beaver-like Wesen.  Eisbiber have a reputation for cowardice (though they prefer to call it \"common sense\". However, they are not quite as cowardly as Mauzhertz, and if left with no other options, they will attempt to fight back when cornered, but if faced with an opponent they know they could not beat, they will run. Eisbiber show gratitude and/or guilt by giving hand-made gifts: fruit pies appear to be something of a go-to choice. They are usually friendly and non-violent, careful not to offend anyone, but they can be very nosy.'"),
(17,"El Cucuy","'A vigilante creature with long claws, a wide mouth filled with razor-sharp teeth, and can hear cries for help from miles away.  El Cucuy have inspired legends in Spanish speaking cultures of a bogeyman-like namesake who punishes those that have done wrong.  The tale is especially used as motivation for children to listen to their parents.'"),
(18,"El Cuegle","'El Cuegle are creatures who possess either blue, or purple-gray skin. They have a third eye which grants future visions with regards to the children that they meet. El Cuegle take no pleasure in eating babies, only doing it to end their vision migraines and to potentially save innocent lives. This displeasure can be so strong, however, that they might be tempted to return the baby they kidnapped. They keep the targeted infant for what is referred to as the \"Hours of Dread.\" This waiting period is no less than one day and no longer than two, dreading having to eat the infant the whole time. El Cuegle will not eat a baby until they are certain of Abortar Mal Futuro (uh-bohr-TAHR MAHL foo-TOO-roh; Span. \"abort the bad future\"), meaning the baby is safe until the El Cuegle confirms through its visions that the baby will indeed inevitably grow up to do bad things.'"),
(19,"Excandesco","'A devil-like Wesen.  Excandescos are among the most dangerous Wesen ever observed, largely because the heat they emanate makes them hard to get close to. They also seem to have a strong case of pyromania and love to commit arson. Some go so far as to make a criminal career out of it. It has been noted that they have a tendency to stick around and watch the fires that they start.'"),
(20,"Folterseele","'A frog-like Wesen.  Many men have difficulty controlling themselves around a female Folterseele, and they have a higher risk of being the target of rape attempts. Because of this and what happens to those who contact them when they woge, Folterseele mostly keep to themselves and avoid romantic relationships. Some go so far as to disfigure their faces to make themselves less attractive, but they also struggle with never being able to experience love.'"),
(21,"Fuchsbau","'A fox-like Wesen.  Generally deemed as \"liars\" by the Wesen community, (\"Cat and Mouse\") Fuchsbaus may deal with shady transactions, including the buying and selling of human organs. Despite this, Fuchsbaus are loyal and friendly to those whom they consider friends.  They generally prefer to avoid confrontation; however, they will fight when forced to do so and will not go down until they at least succeed at biting off something from their adversaries.'"),
(22,"Fuchsteufelwild","'A goblin-like Wesen.  Fuchsteufelwild are highly sadistic and love to play intricate games with their victims. While the nature of their games varies, they all have one thing in common: the victim must guess the Fuchsteufelwild's name, which is always an anagram of the letters that make up the name Rumpelstiltskin. Due to their enormous egos, Fuchsteufelwild will become violent if they feel like they are about to lose, and they will frequently try to kill their victims. If they know there is no way they can win, Fuchsteufelwild will often commit suicide. Despite their formidable offensive capabilities, Fuchsteufelwild prefer to take on their prey one at a time via ambush, likely stemming from their small stature. If faced with multiple well-armed foes, Fuchsteufelwild will run. Fuchsteufelwild are particularly terrified of Grimms.'"),
(23,"Fuilcré","'An ox-like Wesen.  Fuilcré were one of the first Wesen to self-domesticate and cultivate land for food instead of hunting Kehrseite. They are skilled at being farmers and are not considered to be very violent Wesen, but they are known for their past rituals that involved human sacrifice. In modern times, however, most Fuilcré do not perform those types of rituals any longer, which revolved around the stars and constellations. They are also deliberate, straight-forward, and honest in nature.'"),
(24,"Furis Rubian","'A horned toad-like Wesen.  Despite their intimidating look, Furis Rubians are not violent creatures, nor do they condone violence either. Normally having a calm demeanor, they only become aggressive as a last resort, typically in self-defense. Some Furis Rubians choose to use their woged appearance for good and attempt to help others through spiritual and religious healing.  They do not fear Grimms, as many other Wesen do, and their reaction to seeing one is more of surprise and awe. Unlike most Wesen, they know Grimms by their old name: Dēcapitāre.'"),
(25,"Gedächtnis Essner","'An octopus-like Wesen.  Gedächtnis Essers sometimes use their ability to steal memories to take over their victims' identities. Due to their unique skills, they also often work in espionage. It takes considerable effort for them to process these stolen memories. Furthermore, it seems the memories extracted from a Grimm will leave them in a highly traumatized state, given the violence that Grimms often inflict upon Wesen. Consequentially, they are very fearful of Grimms.'"),
(26,"Geier","'A vulture-like Wesen.  Geiers are a communal race, living and working with groups of their own kind. These creatures are harvesters who take pleasure in the pain of others. Geiers gut humans for their organs and blood to use as homeopathic medicines and aphrodisiacs within the Wesen creature community, and they are responsible for procuring such agents for the benefit of Wesen kind. This gruesome practice may be referenced to an actual vulture's role as a scavenger, feeding on the carcasses of people and animals who died in desert areas.'"),
(27,"Gelumcaedus","'An alligator-like Wesen.  Gelumcaedus are commonly known to have dormant periods when they retreat to bunkers fashioned within storm drains and live off of their plunder.  Gelumcaedus are an incredibly aggressive and dangerous Wesen that will attack with little provocation, using their powerful jaws and inhuman strength to literally break apart those that get in their way.'"),
(28,"Genio Innocuo","'A tortoise-like Wesen.  Genio Innocuo are notoriously intelligent, compassionate, and thoroughly nonviolent. However, their own genius has been known to do them more harm than good in some cases.'"),
(29,"Gevatter Tod","'An assassin bug-like Wesen.  The Gevatter Tod have a noteworthy and respected reputation in the Wesen community, but one that is also somber and solemn, as they are known as the \"godfathers of death.\"  To protect the Wesen community, the Gevatter Tod are called by either a family member or a Wesen who cares for another Wesen suffering from dementia. Every Wesen apothecary has a contact number for a Gevatter Tod as well. Once contacted, the Gevatter Tod will eventually arrive and inject the suffering Wesen with their saliva and allow them to pass away more peacefully than what otherwise might happen. This responsibility of the Gevatter Tod has helped keep Wesen hidden from the rest of humanity over time. They do not take this responsibility lightly either and, out of respect to the suffering Wesen, they open a nearby window or door to let the Wesen's soul leave.'"),
(30,"Glühenvolk","' An alien-like Wesen.  Glühenvolk are a benevolent species; they do not like to kill accidentally or intentionally. Male Glühenvolk are extremely caring and protective of their mates, especially if their mate is pregnant. Attempting to harm a Glühenvolk's mate is one of the only ways to elicit a violent response from them. When a female Glühenvolk is pregnant, she must consume cow ovaries to stay healthy. Due to their disdain for violence, Glühenvolk prefer to attack the cows while they are asleep to lessen the rush of adrenaline, and thus, souring the flavor and texture of the meat.'"),
(31,"Hasenfussige Schnecke","'A blobfish-like Wesen.  Despite their inherently friendly nature and innocuous disposition, Hasenfussige Schnecken are cowardly and easily intimidated and coercible, especially when it comes to saving their own lives and even if it involves betraying their friends. When they do not perceive any threat to their own lives, however, and see that someone else's life is in danger, they will try to do something to help save that individual, even if they don't know that person. They are fairly emotional in nature and are not very good liars due to the clues they give off with their body language. If pushed far enough, they will confess to any secrets they are keeping. '"),
(32,"Hässlich","'A troll-like Wesen.  Hässlichen who do not join the Reapers seem to have formed their own mob-like organizations, with a focus on racketeering. They have a natural interest in bridges and have found their niche in inspecting bridges. The Hässlichen believe that all bridges are theirs and demand payment for the right to build new ones. There is an ongoing feud between Hässlichen and Eisbibers, as the latter are often involved in construction, though the Hässlichen have traditionally held the advantage due to the Eisbibers' desire to avoid conflict with them.'"),
(33,"Heftigauroch","'A bull-like Wesen.  Heftigaurochs are normally laid-back and pacifistic. Heftigaurochs who find themselves caught up in violent sports such as boxing are borderline lackadaisical about it. When pushed beyond their limit, Heftigaurochs will become violent. Once they enter a rage, it takes some time to revert back to their normal personalities.'"),
(34,"Hexenbiest","'A witch-like Wesen.  When they woge, unlike many other Wesen, Hexenbiests still appear human; however, their skin decays so that it resembles a corpse, their teeth sharpen, and their hair may turn gray. Their woged appearance becomes more decrepit-looking as they age.  They work at the command of royalty and are extremely loyal creatures, but they are only loyal to whomever they serve, as to others they are treacherous and manipulative, even to their own kind.'"),
(35,"Zauberbiest","'A warlock-like Wesen.  When a Zauberbiest woges, their skin appears more aged and wrinkled than their female counterparts, and their eyes entirely turn a glowing red, almost as if they are hot embers.  Zauberbiest tend to be even more sadistic than Hexenbiests and will even terrorize their own kind if they feel it will help them reach their goals.'"),
(36,"Höllentier","'A hellhound-like Wesen.  Höllentiers are dangerous and brutish Wesen that have an ancient lineage which traces all the way back to the ancient Egyptian empire. Generally speaking, they have a reputation for being unintelligent and in general too dumb to know what they should be afraid of. During Egyptian times, they were often entombed with the pharaohs to act as their guardians in the afterlife. They believed this was a position of power, and only too late did they realize they could not escape.   In modern times, this species as a whole is generally considered to be jerks and will often be recognized by a long criminal record.'"),
(37,"Hundjäger","' A vicious, hound dog-like Wesen.  They're very tenacious when they are on the hunt; they will let nothing stop them from finding their target and will even randomly kill people if they believe it will help.'"),
(38,"Huntha Lami Muuaji","' A flatworm-like Wesen.  Both the male and female forms exist as separate personalities and will communicate with each other, regardless of which one is physically manifesting itself at the time. In more heated arguments, Huntha Lami Muuaji will rapidly switch genders as one side of them speaks up. While existing as separate personalities, both the male and female counterparts are extremely close emotionally with one another, and each form considers its opposite as a lifelong companion. After one was injected with testosterone to trap it in the male form, he expressed great stress due to being unable to woge into and \"find\" his female counterpart.'"),
