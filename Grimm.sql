INSERT INTO characteristics (wesen_id, wesen_name, wesen_characteristics) VALUES
(1,"Alpe","'A sleep eating wesen with green eyes that feeds off melatonin, causing its victim severe insomnia.  Alpen are clever, cunning creatures with a bit of an arrogance in the way they carry themselves.'"),
(2,"Anubis","'A jackal creature considered godlike protectors of the dead by ancient Egyptians. They are respectful of artifacts, and are involved with the Beati Paoli, a group of wesen dedicated to preservation of wesen culture.'"),
(3,"Apgadnieks","'A husky like creature with either body that is white, brown, or both, and a nosed dog-like rhinarium.  They have a natural tendency to be leaders, and as such, they aren't hesitant to give orders or directions when necessary. They are also courageous and more than willing to fight others that may be much bigger or older than they are. Additionally, they are clever and quite resourceful.'"),
(4,"Aswang","'A ghoul creature from Filipino mythology. In the series, aswang attack pregnant women with their piercing tongue, injecting a tranquilizer and sucking the infant and amniotic fluid out of the womb. It is a tradition (which some aswang consider barbaric) for the eldest son to give up his first conceived child for his mother's consumption to extend her lifespan.'"),
(5,"Ataktos Fuse","'A cicada-like wesen with yellowish-brown exoskeleton.  They emerge from underground for just twenty four hours once every seven years. During that time, they will try and consume as much protein as they can, while looking for a large enough person to take back underground with them, where they will feed on that individual until they emerge once again in seven years.'"),
(6,"Balam","'A jaguar creature that is closely related to the Yaguaraté.  They have been known to develop obsessive behavior, specifically when it comes to any harm done to members of the Balam's family. They are extremely daring and, at times, aggressive creatures that tend to act first and think later. However, when facing another formidable Wesen, such as a Blutbad, they tend to back off.'"),
(7,"Barbatus Ossifrage","'A Bearded vulture-like creature that preys on the mortally wounded. It breaks its victims' bones and then liquefies them for consumption.'"),
(8,"Bauerschwein","'A pig-like creature that has been in a centuries-old feud with the blutbads.  They are known for being diligent and hard-working and are capable of interacting with humans in this manner. Unfortunately, Bauerschwein are not particularly strong Wesen, and as such, they are noted to be constant victims of the Blutbad.  They also often take mud baths to help ease their minds and think.'"),
(9,"Blutbad","'A wolf-like creature that has been in a centuries-old feud with bauerschweins.  They have a keen sense of smell that is provoked by the color red.  Blutbaden are incredibly strong, more than any man and most Wesen, and have been shown overpowering their adversaries in both human and Wesen form.'"),
(10,"Coyotl","'A coyote-like creature that are known for being mean, nasty, and all around bullies, and they are often considered the equivalent of street gangs in the Wesen world. They have a very strong pack mentality and don't take kindly to anyone straying from the sacred bond of the pack.'"),
(11,"Cracher-Mortel","'A creature like a Puffer fish, that are confident and incredibly dangerous. They have no problems with infecting innocent people with their spit and using them as \"zombie\" slaves. They also have strong ties to Voodoo ceremonies, as they are responsible for inspiring multiple events. They are generally intelligent and cunning, as well as sophisticated and smartly dressed, often wearing a suit and a top hat. They are also very calm and have a sadistic sense of humor.'"),
(12,"Cupiditas","'A cupid-like wesen that collects victims' hair to make amor de infierno \(Spanish: hellish love). Cupiditas are known to be vengeful creatures who can hold grudges for a very long time. If any of their loved ones are wronged in any way, they will avenge them, usually by making the Amor de Infierno. They do not care much for the lives of others outside of their own family and are willing to kill anyone who stands in the way of them achieving their own brand of vindictive justice. Lacking any particular physical prowess in their woged state, they resort to using their intelligence and sneaky, cunning behavior to their advantage.'"),
(13,"Dämonfeuer","'A rare draconic creature with the ability to vaporize their own fat, which they cough up as flammable particles that can ignite.  Dämonfeuer are treasure-mongers, though in modern times, they have abandoned gold and jewels, instead collecting large amounts of copper, of which they are very possessive. They have no qualms with stealing copper to increase their horde.  Due to their might, Dämonfeuer are not afraid of Grimms.'"),
(14,"Dickfellig","'A rhinoceros-like Wesen.  They are superhumanly strong and durable, and they attack by charging at an intended target.'"),
(15,"Drang-Zorn","'A badger-like Wesen.  They are known to have a very short temper and are very easily enraged, and prone to violent outbursts. However, if faced with an adversary that they know they could not prevail over, Drang-Zorns will instead take refuge in underground dens that they built for cases such as these, and they are quite adept at constructing them. Some Drang-Zorns are better tempered than others and have a kinder, more compassionate side, however.  If a Drang-Zorn were to woge before the age of thirteen, they will suffer from a lack of inhibition needed to control their rage and will become homicidal toward anyone who angers them, even towards their own kind.'"),
(16,"Eisbiber","'A beaver-like Wesen.  Eisbiber have a reputation for cowardice (though they prefer to call it \"common sense\". However, they are not quite as cowardly as Mauzhertz, and if left with no other options, they will attempt to fight back when cornered, but if faced with an opponent they know they could not beat, they will run. Eisbiber show gratitude and/or guilt by giving hand-made gifts: fruit pies appear to be something of a go-to choice. They are usually friendly and non-violent, careful not to offend anyone, but they can be very nosy.'"),
(17,"El Cucuy","'A vigilante creature with long claws, a wide mouth filled with razor-sharp teeth, and can hear cries for help from miles away.  El Cucuy have inspired legends in Spanish speaking cultures of a bogeyman-like namesake who punishes those that have done wrong.  The tale is especially used as motivation for children to listen to their parents.'"),
(18,"El Cuegle","'El Cuegle are creatures who possess either blue, or purple-gray skin. They have a third eye which grants future visions with regards to the children that they meet. El Cuegle take no pleasure in eating babies, only doing it to end their vision migraines and to potentially save innocent lives. This displeasure can be so strong, however, that they might be tempted to return the baby they kidnapped. They keep the targeted infant for what is referred to as the \"Hours of Dread.\" This waiting period is no less than one day and no longer than two, dreading having to eat the infant the whole time. El Cuegle will not eat a baby until they are certain of Abortar Mal Futuro (uh-bohr-TAHR MAHL foo-TOO-roh; Span. \"abort the bad future\"), meaning the baby is safe until the El Cuegle confirms through its visions that the baby will indeed inevitably grow up to do bad things.'"),
(19,"Excandesco","'A devil-like Wesen.  Excandescos are among the most dangerous Wesen ever observed, largely because the heat they emanate makes them hard to get close to. They also seem to have a strong case of pyromania and love to commit arson. Some go so far as to make a criminal career out of it. It has been noted that they have a tendency to stick around and watch the fires that they start.'"),
(20,"Folterseele","'A frog-like Wesen.  Many men have difficulty controlling themselves around a female Folterseele, and they have a higher risk of being the target of rape attempts. Because of this and what happens to those who contact them when they woge, Folterseele mostly keep to themselves and avoid romantic relationships. Some go so far as to disfigure their faces to make themselves less attractive, but they also struggle with never being able to experience love.'"),
(21,"Fuchsbau","'A fox-like Wesen.  Generally deemed as \"liars\" by the Wesen community, (\"Cat and Mouse\") Fuchsbaus may deal with shady transactions, including the buying and selling of human organs. Despite this, Fuchsbaus are loyal and friendly to those whom they consider friends.  They generally prefer to avoid confrontation; however, they will fight when forced to do so and will not go down until they at least succeed at biting off something from their adversaries.'"),
(22,"Fuchsteufelwild","'A goblin-like Wesen.  Fuchsteufelwild are highly sadistic and love to play intricate games with their victims. While the nature of their games varies, they all have one thing in common: the victim must guess the Fuchsteufelwild's name, which is always an anagram of the letters that make up the name Rumpelstiltskin. Due to their enormous egos, Fuchsteufelwild will become violent if they feel like they are about to lose, and they will frequently try to kill their victims. If they know there is no way they can win, Fuchsteufelwild will often commit suicide. Despite their formidable offensive capabilities, Fuchsteufelwild prefer to take on their prey one at a time via ambush, likely stemming from their small stature. If faced with multiple well-armed foes, Fuchsteufelwild will run. Fuchsteufelwild are particularly terrified of Grimms.'"),
(23,"Fuilcré","'An ox-like Wesen.  Fuilcré were one of the first Wesen to self-domesticate and cultivate land for food instead of hunting Kehrseite. They are skilled at being farmers and are not considered to be very violent Wesen, but they are known for their past rituals that involved human sacrifice. In modern times, however, most Fuilcré do not perform those types of rituals any longer, which revolved around the stars and constellations. They are also deliberate, straight-forward, and honest in nature.'"),
(24,"Furis Rubian","'A horned toad-like Wesen.  Despite their intimidating look, Furis Rubians are not violent creatures, nor do they condone violence either. Normally having a calm demeanor, they only become aggressive as a last resort, typically in self-defense. Some Furis Rubians choose to use their woged appearance for good and attempt to help others through spiritual and religious healing.  They do not fear Grimms, as many other Wesen do, and their reaction to seeing one is more of surprise and awe. Unlike most Wesen, they know Grimms by their old name: Dēcapitāre.'"),
(25,"Gedächtnis Essner","'An octopus-like Wesen.  Gedächtnis Essers sometimes use their ability to steal memories to take over their victims' identities. Due to their unique skills, they also often work in espionage. It takes considerable effort for them to process these stolen memories. Furthermore, it seems the memories extracted from a Grimm will leave them in a highly traumatized state, given the violence that Grimms often inflict upon Wesen. Consequentially, they are very fearful of Grimms.'"),
(26,"Geier","'A vulture-like Wesen.  Geiers are a communal race, living and working with groups of their own kind. These creatures are harvesters who take pleasure in the pain of others. Geiers gut humans for their organs and blood to use as homeopathic medicines and aphrodisiacs within the Wesen creature community, and they are responsible for procuring such agents for the benefit of Wesen kind. This gruesome practice may be referenced to an actual vulture's role as a scavenger, feeding on the carcasses of people and animals who died in desert areas.'"),
(27,"Gelumcaedus","'An alligator-like Wesen.  Gelumcaedus are commonly known to have dormant periods when they retreat to bunkers fashioned within storm drains and live off of their plunder.  Gelumcaedus are an incredibly aggressive and dangerous Wesen that will attack with little provocation, using their powerful jaws and inhuman strength to literally break apart those that get in their way.'"),
(28,"Genio Innocuo","'A tortoise-like Wesen.  Genio Innocuo are notoriously intelligent, compassionate, and thoroughly nonviolent. However, their own genius has been known to do them more harm than good in some cases.'"),
(29,"Gevatter Tod","'An assassin bug-like Wesen.  The Gevatter Tod have a noteworthy and respected reputation in the Wesen community, but one that is also somber and solemn, as they are known as the \"godfathers of death.\"  To protect the Wesen community, the Gevatter Tod are called by either a family member or a Wesen who cares for another Wesen suffering from dementia. Every Wesen apothecary has a contact number for a Gevatter Tod as well. Once contacted, the Gevatter Tod will eventually arrive and inject the suffering Wesen with their saliva and allow them to pass away more peacefully than what otherwise might happen. This responsibility of the Gevatter Tod has helped keep Wesen hidden from the rest of humanity over time. They do not take this responsibility lightly either and, out of respect to the suffering Wesen, they open a nearby window or door to let the Wesen's soul leave.'"),
(30,"Glühenvolk","' An alien-like Wesen.  Glühenvolk are a benevolent species; they do not like to kill accidentally or intentionally. Male Glühenvolk are extremely caring and protective of their mates, especially if their mate is pregnant. Attempting to harm a Glühenvolk's mate is one of the only ways to elicit a violent response from them. When a female Glühenvolk is pregnant, she must consume cow ovaries to stay healthy. Due to their disdain for violence, Glühenvolk prefer to attack the cows while they are asleep to lessen the rush of adrenaline, and thus, souring the flavor and texture of the meat.'"),
(31,"Hasenfussige Schnecke","'A blobfish-like Wesen.  Despite their inherently friendly nature and innocuous disposition, Hasenfussige Schnecken are cowardly and easily intimidated and coercible, especially when it comes to saving their own lives and even if it involves betraying their friends. When they do not perceive any threat to their own lives, however, and see that someone else's life is in danger, they will try to do something to help save that individual, even if they don't know that person. They are fairly emotional in nature and are not very good liars due to the clues they give off with their body language. If pushed far enough, they will confess to any secrets they are keeping. '"),
(32,"Hässlich","'A troll-like Wesen.  Hässlichen who do not join the Reapers seem to have formed their own mob-like organizations, with a focus on racketeering. They have a natural interest in bridges and have found their niche in inspecting bridges. The Hässlichen believe that all bridges are theirs and demand payment for the right to build new ones. There is an ongoing feud between Hässlichen and Eisbibers, as the latter are often involved in construction, though the Hässlichen have traditionally held the advantage due to the Eisbibers' desire to avoid conflict with them.'"),
(33,"Heftigauroch","'A bull-like Wesen.  Heftigaurochs are normally laid-back and pacifistic. Heftigaurochs who find themselves caught up in violent sports such as boxing are borderline lackadaisical about it. When pushed beyond their limit, Heftigaurochs will become violent. Once they enter a rage, it takes some time to revert back to their normal personalities.'"),
(34,"Hexenbiest","'A witch-like Wesen.  When they woge, unlike many other Wesen, Hexenbiests still appear human; however, their skin decays so that it resembles a corpse, their teeth sharpen, and their hair may turn gray. Their woged appearance becomes more decrepit-looking as they age.  They work at the command of royalty and are extremely loyal creatures, but they are only loyal to whomever they serve, as to others they are treacherous and manipulative, even to their own kind.'"),
(35,"Zauberbiest","'A warlock-like Wesen.  When a Zauberbiest woges, their skin appears more aged and wrinkled than their female counterparts, and their eyes entirely turn a glowing red, almost as if they are hot embers.  Zauberbiest tend to be even more sadistic than Hexenbiests and will even terrorize their own kind if they feel it will help them reach their goals.'"),
(36,"Höllentier","'A hellhound-like Wesen.  Höllentiers are dangerous and brutish Wesen that have an ancient lineage which traces all the way back to the ancient Egyptian empire. Generally speaking, they have a reputation for being unintelligent and in general too dumb to know what they should be afraid of. During Egyptian times, they were often entombed with the pharaohs to act as their guardians in the afterlife. They believed this was a position of power, and only too late did they realize they could not escape.   In modern times, this species as a whole is generally considered to be jerks and will often be recognized by a long criminal record.'"),
(37,"Hundjäger","' A vicious, hound dog-like Wesen.  They're very tenacious when they are on the hunt; they will let nothing stop them from finding their target and will even randomly kill people if they believe it will help.'"),
(38,"Huntha Lami Muuaji","' A flatworm-like Wesen.  Both the male and female forms exist as separate personalities and will communicate with each other, regardless of which one is physically manifesting itself at the time. In more heated arguments, Huntha Lami Muuaji will rapidly switch genders as one side of them speaks up. While existing as separate personalities, both the male and female counterparts are extremely close emotionally with one another, and each form considers its opposite as a lifelong companion. After one was injected with testosterone to trap it in the male form, he expressed great stress due to being unable to woge into and \"find\" his female counterpart.'"),
(39,"Indole Gentile","'A sweet, doe-faced (innocent-looking/non-threatening) Wesen.  Indole Gentile were referred to by Monroe as \"very nice people\", and even Grimms consider them completely harmless.'"),
(40,"Inugami","'A ghost dog-like Wesen.  Inugami are deeply devoted to their traditions of honor. Their fighting capabilities and swordsman skills make them extremely capable samurai-like guardians. If someone saves their lives, they will become bound in servitude and honor to protect both them and their family. Thus, they have a reputation of being near-spiritual protectors.  Inugami have an especially cruel method of execution. Inugami will kidnap their victims from their home, where the Inugami in question will leave behind an origami dog, and then bury them up to their neck facing northeast towards a river. They will then decapitate them with a katana, upon which they perform a Shinto blessing before capturing their victim, and throw their head under a bridge. This is done to prevent the victim's soul from ever reaching the afterlife, trapping them in a state of perpetual agony.'"),
(41,"Jägerbar","'A bear-like Wesen.  In ancient times, Jägerbars practiced a brutal and savage ritual called the Roh-hatz to celebrate their young becoming adults. They would kidnap two humans and hunt them like animals.  In the modern era, Jägerbars have found a more civilized role in society. They can easily live among humans and are mostly civil and non-hostile. They can be found as lawyers, clerks, and the like. As such, their more barbaric practices, such as the Roh-Hatz, are rarely performed.'"),
(42,"Jinnamuru Xunte","'A fly-like Wesen.  Jinnamuru Xunte spray a type of parasitic worm from their mouths into their victims eyes, which renders their victims blind. They can spray the worms both in their human form and when woged. The worms are covered in hooks and barbs, which makes them impossible to remove from their victims' eyes. If left untreated, the worms will continue to grow until they completely devour and bore through the victim's eyes. Due to their insatiable thirst for tears, they have been known to work as priests and in other positions that frequently deal with high emotion. Jinnamuru Xunte frequently re-visit their victims, targeting family members whose tears are readily accessible.'"),
(43,"Kackenkopf", "'A dung beetle-like Wesen.  These creatures tend to keep bad company and can be even worse company themselves. They are very emotionally volatile and can start behaving violently and aggressively with little warning or provocation. As such, it does not take much to set them off. They have an inclination to use drugs and engage in illegal activities, which typically involves petty crimes. Those that Kackenkopf actually offer to \"help\" may one day really find themselves in their debt, as these Wesen rarely, if ever, do any favors for anyone without the expectation of something back in return.'"),
(44,"Kitsune","'A fox-like Wesen.  Kitsune are very reserved Wesen; however, if a member of their family is killed, they will be enraged and can be prone to holding grudges in that instance. Their families tend to be very close with one another. In modern times, they disagree with more draconian methods of vengeance, such as those that include murder or are practiced by the Inugami, Wesen that are bound in servitude by a samurai-like honor and tradition to Kitsune families if their life is saved by a Kitsune. However, not all Kitsune are aware of when an Inugami is bound to protect them.'"),
(45,"Klaustreich","'An alley cat-like Wesen.  Female Klaustreichs are not nearly as aggressive nor as treacherous as their male counterparts, but they tend to keep bad company and can sometimes be found in a line of work that is not very reputable. Female Klaustreichs do care deeply for their friends, however, and will look out for those they care about much more than male Klaustreichs do.  Klaustreichs, particularly males, enjoy harassing Reinigen for fun in a pastime known as Reini-bashing. The goal is usually to just beat up the Reinigen, but on some occasions, the Reinigen is killed.'"),
(46,"Konigschlange","'A king cobra-like Wesen.  They are an extremely unpleasant and dangerous Wesen species.  Königschlange also can be somewhat sadistic and enjoy intimidating others.  They are highly suspicious creatures and are very rarely deceived. Königschlange possess superhuman strength and are strong enough to fight with a Grimm.'"),
(47,"Koschie","'A radioactive skeleton man-like Wesen.  Koschie are very free-spirited, in the sense that they have a very large libido and often use their reputation as healers to woo females. Using their healing abilities also \"fires up\" their sex drive. They enjoy drinking, they remember the names of everyone they've killed, and they can feel very remorseful after taking a life. They sometimes use their ability to heal to make up for the lives they have taken.'"),
(48,"Krampus","'An anti-Santa Wesen resembling a wild sheep.  Even among Wesen, Krampus is unique. He is not aware that he is Krampus or even Wesen. He is only able to woge from the first of December to the twenty-first when he enters a state of constant woge so fixed that even the loss of consciousness is unable to cause him to revert. It is during this time that Krampus can be said to actually exist.  Krampus hunts naughty children and adolescents, admonishing them for their bad behavior before beating them with a wooden switch and stuffing them in a large sack, leaving a large lump of coal behind at the abduction site.'"),
(49,"Lausenschlange","'A snake-like Wesen.  Though they have fangs, they fight more like boa constrictors, strangling their prey with the very strong grip of their arms. They consider Mauzhertz their natural prey and will casually kill and eat them. Lausenschlange are known to be naturally aggressive, but they are perfectly capable of living with humans and having normal lives.'"),
(50,"Lebensauger","'A leech-like Wesen.  Due to their hideous appearance, they often experience self-loathing and even identity crisis, preferring to become what they want to be. They are generally considered to be amongst the most repulsive of Wesen and are consequently known to be prone to substance abuse. Lebensaugers are exceptionally good at keeping their true nature a secret and rarely woge in front of other Wesen. They are also very good actors, partially due to their ability and their strong desire to adopt the identity of who they want to be. Their mastery of woge suppression and their acting talents allow Lebensaugers to keep their true natures hidden. Lebensaugers who do not suffer from self-loathing tend to be sadistic, using fear to get their way.'"),
(51,"Löwen","'A lion-like Wesen.  Löwen are naturally aggressive, competitive, and violent, and they are also known for having a horrible temper. Despite this, they are still capable of peacefully living amongst humans and having normal lives.'"),
(52,"Luisant-Pêcheur","'An otter-like Wesen.  Most of the time, they are quiet, kind, and gentle. They are also more at home in the water than on land. They are similar to Eisbibers but are typically less skittish, though they certainly can become quite nervous in the presence of a Grimm, who they are very fearful of.  Plus, they are intelligent.'"),
(53,"Luison","'A wolf-like Wesen.  Luison can come off as being suave and polite, but they're typically greedy and out to make a fortune. They are not above betraying and manipulating loved ones for monetary gains. On the other hand, they aren't as prone to resorting to violence as Blutbaden are, and they rely more on deception and psychological fear to achieve their goals.'"),
(54,"Malin Fatal","'A boar-like Wesen.  Malin Fatal are formidable foes, being both aggressive and intelligent. They kill their victims by slitting their throat with their tusks and leaving the victim to bleed out. Malin Fatal are also great defenders.'"),
(55,"Manticore","'A half-lion, half-scorpion-like Wesen.  Manticores are similar in temperament to a Dämonfeuer or a Taureus-Armenta in that they are not afraid of death and view dying in battle as a very noble and worthy death. This, of course, means that they are excellent soldiers, willing to fight for what they believe in. This species can often be found on the front lines of battle with the likes of Steinadlers.'"),
(56,"Matança Zumbido","'An electric eel-like Wesen.  Matança Zumbido appear to be somewhat possessive and do not like when their spouse cheats. It is also possible for them to go insane over traumatic events. On the other hand, they are noted to be a Wesen that is considered horrifying and extremely dangerous when provoked or confronted.'"),
(57,"Mauvais Dentes","'A saber-toothed cat-like Wesen.  There aren't many left in the world, but based on the accounts of the Grimm ancestry, they are vicious killing machines with the ability to wipe out an entire village single handedly. They have a reputation for baiting their victims before killing them, enjoying tricking and deceiving their opponents, much like cats. Like Hundjägers, Mauvais Dentes have no qualms endangering innocent bystanders if that would bring them much closer to the designated targets.'"),
(58,"Mauzhertz","'A mouse-like Wesen.  Mauzhertz are, by nature, very timid and exceedingly cowardly, oftentimes afraid of their own shadow. They are very predictable, which makes them easy prey for Lausenschlange, their natural predators. However, just like humans, they can suffer from serious mental health conditions, which may even lead to them becoming violent and even murderous.'"),
(59,"Mellifer","'A bee-like Wesen.  Mellifers are a communal race who live in small groups ruled by the Mellischwuler with the others acting as her \"worker bees.\" In the Wesen society, they fulfill the role of clarions, sending warning calls within the creature world.  Like real bees, Mellifers operate with a \"hive mentality\" and live in man-made, human sized \"hives.\" They tend to build those \"hives\" in the attics of houses, where they harvest their own apitoxin (bee venom). They inject the deadly toxin to their enemies using the Mellifer Stinger, a syringe-like device.  Under normal circumstance, Mellifers aren't aggressive unless they feel threatened. However, when they do sometimes go after someone with the intent to kill, they use coordinated strategies to disguise their attack. Hexenbiests are their sworn enemies, and Mellifers often kill them on sight.'"),
(60,"Murciélago","'A bat-like Wesen.  Murciélagos seem to have more extreme emotional levels; they can be calm and creative, producing masterpieces such as Spencer's painting in the beginning of \"Happily Ever Aftermath\", or they can be selfish, spiteful, and caring only for themselves.'"),
(61,"Musai","'A muse-like Wesen.  Similar to Ziegevolk with women, Musai don't seem to try to hide the influence that they have over men. They also don't feel guilty about the death and destruction that they cause, thinking that they have done nothing wrong. They believe that a short, artistic, and passionate life is better than living a long life with untapped potential. They are passionate about art and target artists or those with untapped creative potential, such as authors or composers. They claim to be able to sense untapped power in people, which is what draws them to their victims. They normally target one victim at a time, and once their first victim ends up dead or insane after creating masterpieces, they move on to their next target. The relationship between the Musai and their victim causes the victim to become obsessive, willing to kill or die to be with her. The only way to cure the effects of a Musai's kiss is with true love.'"),
(62,"Musasat Alsh-Shabab","'A scarab beetle-like Wesen.  Some Musasat Alsh-Shabab use their ability to steal a person's Yanbue and make money selling it for cosmetic purposes. They find young victims and either drug or overpower them before extracting the Yanbue. Despite their greed, they are wary creatures, well aware of the effects that Yanbue will have if overused and the dangers of bringing too much attention or suspicion on themselves.  Despite their wariness, Musasat Alsh-Shabab will fight if confronted, even against Grimms. They also are willing to use their mandibles offensively.'"),
(63,"Naiad","'A mermaid-like Wesen.  Naiads are extremely protective and loyal to their families. They keep each other's secrets, protect one another, and watch each other's backs. Several have even been willing to die of dehydration rather than give up one of their own.  Since male Naiads are born sterile, female Naiads must reproduce with other men in order to continue the species.'"),
(64,"Nuckelavee","'A horse-like Wesen.  Nuckelavee are stealthy, quiet, and calm Wesen that approach tasks logically. They have no qualms with stealing or murder as long as it helps them to succeed in their appointed task. As such, they are able to find employment working for the Seven Royal Households. They also possess incredible determination and would rather die than fail at their tasks.'"),
(65,"Pflichttreue","'A white panther-like Wesen.  Pflichttreue are smart, fearless, and extremely loyal. Because of these traits, several were used by the Wesen Council to help with some of their most difficult dirty work.'"),
(66,"Phansigar","'A Komodo dragon-like Wesen.  Phansigars were once affiliated with the Thuggees. However, Phansigars have their own specific rituals for human sacrifice. Every three years they sacrifice one man and one woman, usually a couple, to the goddess Kali by choking them with their tongues to knock them out, and then, after a ritual involving prayers in Hindi, the victims are buried alive.  These sacrifices take place in front of a giant idol built in the Phansigar's image. Phansigars consider the ground on which they commit these sacrifices sacred and will kill anyone who trespasses upon it. They also leave similar, smaller idols behind at the sites where they kidnap their victims.'"),
(67,"Quijada Vil","'A Gila monster-like Wesen.  They are very opportunistic, calculating, and clever Wesen. They also have the ability to skillfully hide any sadistic or menacing qualities they may have, a skill they use to their advantage when they can in order to further surprise and ambush unsuspecting victims. When they attack, they tend to go for the neck first.'"),
(68,"Raub-Kondor","'A condor-like Wesen.  Raub-Kondors are ruthless, dedicated, and dangerous hunters. They have been known to track their prey over hundreds of miles. They are also good at tracking them through the use of falsehood, thus allowing them to gather information, unsuspected.  As well as being ruthless, they are also greedy creatures and obsessed with wealth. They are more than willing to murder, butcher, and skin sapient beings in their quest for wealth. They always come armed with barbaric tools and specialized equipment to make their jobs easier.'"),
(69,"Reinigen","'A rat-like Wesen.  They are similar to rats in that they are scavengers, not being the least bit picky about what they eat. The quality or hygiene of their living conditions is often poor as well. They appear to be peaceful creatures like their fellow rodent Wesen, Eisbibers, Mauzhertz, and Stangebärs, but unlike them (except Stangebärs), Reinigen are nowhere near as meek or cowardly.  Despite being cautious and generally non-violent, Reinigen can be very temperamental, especially if they have a history of being treated poorly. If a Reinigen loses his or her temper, he or she will lash out violently against their offenders. Reinigen appear to have a tendency to hold grudges.  Reinigen also appear to have an affinity for actual rats.'"),
(70,"Schakal","'A jackal-like Wesen.  Over the centuries, they have proven to be naturally aggressive, cruel, and violent, and they will let nothing stand in the way of their goals. Grimms have executed Schakal by beheading like they have with so many other Wesen. In this case, an iron-wrought Schakal Axe is most often used to commit the beheadings. Schakal are seemingly social Wesen and are commonly seen working with groups of their own kind, though there is often an air of mistrust and hostility amongst them.'"),
(71,"Scharfblicke","'An owl-like Wesen.  Not much is known about their behavior, other than that they are willing to do secret small jobs for people and to never talk about the job afterwards.'"),
(72,"Schinderdiv","'A warthog-like Wesen.  A Schinderdiv is ruthless and selfish and is not to be trusted. They only act for themselves and will do anything to achieve a goal. They use their brute force strength to pin victims and their tusks to inflict damage. They appear to be unafraid of Grimms and are hostile towards them. As a very powerful Wesen, they are not above taking them on in a fight. One way to deal with this Wesen in a fight is to jump on its back and use its tusks as leverage to break its neck.'"),
(73,"Seelengut","'A sheep-like Wesen.  They are timid and peaceful creatures who are almost never violent. They are also a highly social species that tend to congregate in large groups.  Like Bauerschwein, Seelenguter are normally considered by Blutbaden to be prey.'"),
(74,"Seltenvogel","'A rare bird-like Wesen.  They appear to be a naturally timid race, that's easily controlled by simple reassurances.'"),
(75,"Siegbarste","'An ogre-like Wesen.  Aside from being notoriously hard to kill, Siegbarstes are also infamous for holding grudges to the grave and will not stop until either they're dead or the person who offended them is dead. Siegbarstes will use unspeakably brutal methods to kill their offenders. However, some Siegbarstes are just as capable of forming positive relationships with others.  Tight, enclosed spaces make them irritable.'"),
(76,"Skalengeck","'A lizard-like Wesen.  Skalengecks usually intimidate their prey by greeting them with a hostile grin and their tongues hanging out. They are a species not renowned for their intelligence or width of knowledge. They are often aggressive, irrational, and violent. This can lead them to try and take on far superior opponents. The majority of them are criminals, ranging from addicts and sexual abusers to robbers and murderers.'"),
(77,"Skalenzahne","'A crocodile-like Wesen.  Typically, these creatures exist peacefully among the human population, though it has been noted that they may attack without any provocation.  Additionally, they can become barbaric when introduced to the taste of human or Wesen flesh. In this state, they will savagely kill all, even their friends. Once entering this state, they become incredibly carnivorous, devouring meat like a starving animal, regardless of what sort of meat it is.'"),
(78,"Spinnetod","'A spider-like Wesen.  Females are known to kill their mates shortly after copulation.  They have an attraction to shiny objects, such as watches, and dislike water. It is not known why Spinnetods are attracted to shiny objects, and even Spinnetods themselves do not understand the attraction.  Some Spinnetods choose not to live this violent lifestyle, and they are known as Wieder Spinnetod.   Wieder Spinnetods don't appear to need the strict regimen of diet, drugs, and exercise other Wesen like Blutbaden require. However, they must refrain from wearing shiny things because this encourages the Spinnetod impulses. Unfortunately, female Wieder Spinnetods experience the effects of rapid aging since they are unable to molt without consuming human entrails.'"),
(79,"Stangebär","'A porcupine-like Wesen.  Stangebären are generally peaceful and docile, similar in nature to their fellow rodent Wesen, such as Mauzhertz, Reinigen, and Eisbibers. Unlike Mauzhertz and Eisbibers, Stangebärs are not cowardly and will resort to violence, but only when they have to. They tend to find work in areas that allow them to be outdoors.'"),
(80,"Steinadler","'A hawk-like Wesen.  Steinadlers are known for their ability to poker-facedly exhibit simultaneous friendliness and sternness, so it is impossible to tell whose side one is on. The ability to sternly influence others as though they were subordinate friends makes the Steinadler excellent military figures. They have a reputation for being heroes and adventurers as well as having high intellect and good intuition.'"),
(81,"Taureus-Armenta","'A minotaur-like Wesen.  The Taureus-Armenta is famous for stubbornness and courage in the face of adversity. Highly respected on the battlefield, this Wesen is often found on the front lines, willing to face any enemy, with nerves of steel under fire. Known for its powerful inclination to volunteer for even the most dangerous tasks, the creature is steadfast in its approach and is amongst the most honorable of Wesen. A Taureus-Armenta does not fear death. Despite its renowned courage and strength, it is terrified of Grimms and will not even bother fighting; it will simply attempt to run away if confronted by one of them.'"),
(82,"Taweret","'A hippopotamus-like Wesen.  Taweret appear to be a laid-back and easygoing species. They are not inherently belligerent, but they will defend themselves when threatened, even if it means killing their aggressor. Females are social beings who take very kindly to chivalrous gestures.'"),
(83,"Uhranuti","'A falcon-like Wesen.  Uhranuti often find work as killers for hire. As demonstrated by Marwan Hanano, their great eyesight makes them excellent snipers. Uhranuti are calculating and very clever as well, and they don't like it when they feel as if they do not have the element of surprise on their side. When they can't surprise their target, they will try to run instead and only fight if they have to. They are quite stealthy, however, and can be quite resourceful in regards to using their surroundings as needed. Though it is unknown how they react to Grimms, they appear to show little fear at all when face-to-face with other Wesen that are quite dangerous, such as Mauvais Dentes.'"),
(84,"Ungeziefer Greifer","'A weasel-like Wesen.  Though not quite as skittish as Mauzhertz, Ungeziefer Greifer are still relatively quick to run away from a fight, particularly if they encounter Grimms, whom they fear greatly. At close range, they can be quick enough to land a bite on an adversary, but they will still run away after doing so. They often find work in subservient roles to others who are more powerful than they are, such as Blutbaden, and they are quite loyal to them. If they come across information that is pertinent for their supervisor or leader to know, they will not hesitate to run off and disclose it to them; as such, it is probably not wise to expect Ungeziefer Greifer to be very good at keeping secrets, though they are straightforward and honest, albeit in a bit of a duplicitous manner at times.'"),
(85,"Unnamed Red Herring-like Wesen","'A Wesen resembling a literal red herring.  Not much is known about this Wesen's behavior, other than that they tend to be reclusive and do not say much. Their nature is inherently mysterious and, in turn, can mistakenly lead to them becoming initial suspects in the course of criminal investigations. They appear to particularly enjoy raising such false suspicion surrounding themselves, however. Along the same lines, they appear to have what one may describe as a \"unique,\" if not good, sense of humor.'"),
(86,"Varme Tyv","'A snake-like Wesen.  Varme Tyv are normally harmless creatures, but if they are not able to join a hibernaculum, they will steal the heat of others, killing them in doing so. They are said to be the most lethal in winter, as their desperation to survive often leads to them victimizing others. It is unwise to wake them from brumation, as they will be prone to react with open hostility and be willing to attack anybody who wakes them. However, they usually don't get very far as the cold will eventually catch up and overwhelm them.'"),
(87,"Vibora Dorada","'A chimeric snake-like Wesen.  Most Santeria priests, or Santeros, are comprised of Vibora Dorada. In Aztec mythology, Xipe Totec was a deity of life, death, and rebirth, among several other things, and he was known to flay his victims and wear their skin, absorbing their power in doing so. This practice was both worshiped and imitated by Aztec warriors, and in modern times, Vibora Dorada, particularly those that are Santeros, continue the practice with the skin of other Wesen. Their ability to paralyze others with their toxic bite allows them to then flay their victims' faces and make masks out of them, which Santeros imbue with the ability to transfer the Wesen's power onto its wearer, including Kehrseite. Vibora Dorada who become Santeros make other potions as well, but they take the practice of making powerful masks extremely seriously, going to the extent of signing a contract in blood, along with the owner of the mask. They are quite dedicated to their craft but can be absolutely ruthless and cold-blooded when they kill.'"),
(88,"Vulpesmyrca","'A black fox-like Wesen.  They have an innate desire to hunt and kill, but they do not always hunt and kill for their own survival, sometimes choosing to make a career out of it as a Leporem Venator. When hunting, they are extremely opportunistic, often waiting to strike until their intended victims are alone or isolated. They will often gain additional advantages over their targets before they attack via deceptive tactics, such as playing an accordion to distract or lure in those they are hunting. They are excellent at tracking and have adapted to modern technology as well, such as tracking bugs.'"),
(89,"Wældreór","'A Wesen suffering from Ka Dinga Pepo, a rare blood disease related to Dengue fever.  The disease only affects canid Wesen, and Wældreórs are the inspiration of the Chupacabra legend.  When woged as a Wældreór, victims are savage monsters with an appetite for blood. With their normal personalities suppressed, they will even go after friends and loved ones to slake their thirst. Wældreór feed by tearing open a person's neck and sucking up the blood. Sufferers retain no memories of what they did as a Wældreór.'"),
(90,"Wasser Zahne","'an aquatic reptilian-like Wesen.  It is in their nature to fight or prey upon those they perceive to be weaker than them, and they will not hesitate to eliminate those individuals if they attack.'"),
(91,"Wendigo","'A cannibal-like Wesen.  In the distant past, Wendigos were savage cave dwellers in which they carelessly stored the remains of their victims. In modern times, however, Wendigos have been forced to adapt, and now store the remains of past meals in pits located in the basements or crawl spaces of their homes.  Despite adopting a more civilized veneer, Wendigos are extremely savage when provoked.'"),
(92,"Weten Ogen","'A lynx-like Wesen.  Weten Ogen traditionally partake in the Maagd Zoektocht, an ancient tradition, to determine husbands for their daughters. They are somewhat patriarchal in nature, holding onto ancient traditions. Weten Ogen are also fiercely protective of their children and will often attempt to kill anyone who kills their offspring. They commonly kill by using their fangs to rip out their victim's throat, and they prefer to ambush or surprise their victims when they attack them. Weten Ogen feel very little, if any, reluctance or compunction when it comes to killing their own kind, and in regard to the Maagd Zoektocht, doing so can be a way for a participant to prove their worthiness and cunning.'"),
(93,"Wettbewerbsgewinner","'An avian + reptilian-like Wesen.  Not much is known about their behavior, though they seem to be loyal to those they serve. They do not possess superior intelligence and are capable of being easily tricked.'"),
(94,"Wildermann","'A hominid-like Wesen.  ronically, despite their rather frightening appearance, Wildermann are normally a very friendly Wesen species. Wildermann tend to be loners who enjoy nature and activities such as campfires, hiking, and camping. Despite their peaceful natures, Wildermann will resort to violence when they feel it is necessary. When enraged, a Wildermann is a terrifying sight to behold.  Many Wildermann are highly self-conscious about their woge. Consequently, they will seek professional psychiatric help worrying they suffer from a lack of impulse control, when, in fact, they do not.  Famous Wildermann have historically been poets and supporters of transcendentalism. They neither reject civilization nor fully embrace wilderness, representing their solitary preferences while also showing their unwillingness to give in completely to their inner beast.'"),
(95,"Wildesheer","'A wolf-like Wesen.  Wildesheer are ferocious and extremely aggressive Wesen that historically made up the majority of the dangerous Nordic warriors that became known as \"Berserkers.\" Their extremely fearsome battlefield prowess is due to the horrific way in which they fight. Wildesheer enter the battlefield with no fear of death, fighting in a trance-like state of murderous fury. They take down opponents by way of a broken neck and coat themselves with the blood of their victims. In addition, they will scalp their defeated enemies and sew the various scalps into a cloak that they will don for their next battle. The Wildesheer supposedly draws from these scalps, the power of those they once belonged to. In the modern day, Wildesheer will target powerful people in uniform (state troopers, police officers, military veterans, etc.) who are considered modern day warriors and continue their gruesome tradition of scalp collecting. They appear to hold a level of respect for their opponents, deeming them worthy before scalping them. Wildesheer also lead generally nomadic lifestyles, traveling from city to city to find worthy victims, but aren't above hunting in small groups.  Due to their obsession with fighting warriors, Wildesheer are willing to hunt Grimms. They've been known to start entire hunts for one, and they have been doing this for centuries. Upon arriving before the confrontation, there is a brief storm of lightning, thunder, and wind, as if the beasts are \"blown out of hell.\"  Due to their prowess, Wildesheer are greatly feared throughout the entire Wesen community. Blutbaden tell stories of Wildesheer killing Grimms to their children.'"),
(96,"Willahara","'a rabbit-like Wesen.  Willahara are very passive creatures, not liking to woge in front of even other Wesen. Like many Wesen, they are afraid of Grimms and avoid them. They also greatly fear Wesen who hunt them for their feet; these hunters are known as Leporem Venators. Willaharas are still being victimized by these hunters and have been hunted for so long by them that all members of the species know of them without even needing to see them. They are instantly recognizable to Willaharas by the tremendous labryses they wield as well, a type of axe. Once a Willahara family becomes targeted, they do not stay in one place very long but will continue to stay together.'"),
(97,"Yaguareté","'A jaguar-like Wesen.  Yaguaraté are a shy species, especially compared to their close relative, the Balam. However, they have a temper that they must learn to deal with over time, and when pushed to the limit, they can be very dangerous and effective killing machines. When a matter involves a family member or loved one, they will do anything to save them, including killing the attacker. In fact, during a high-stakes confrontation, a Yaguaraté will show little signs of fear, unless they are dealing with a Grimm, which, like most Wesen, they are extremely fearful of. Yaguaraté take down prey with a pounce, similar to a Rißfleisch, and rip out the victim's throat with their mouth, similar to a Mauvais Dentes. They appear to be very skilled at concealing their true identity, even resisting woge when under large amounts of stress. More aggressive members of the species will sometimes get together and form notorious street gangs, taking advantage of their jaguar-like instincts.'"),
(98,"Ziegevolk","'A goat-like Wesen.  The Ziegevolk are rather meek creatures and will always run rather than fight. They generally do not intend to kill their victims and are considered lovers, not fighters. They are commonly celebrities in Hollywood, and many are game show hosts. Ziegevolk are often found in bars, where they use their pheromones to lure and seduce victims. They are normally manipulative and arrogant creatures but are often mostly harmless. Ziegevolk that eat toads are not breeders, but herders, a rarity amongst the species.  The toads stimulate a gland in the brain that controls the secretion of sweat. Larger volumes of pheromone-filled sweat can force anyone to do whatever they say.  When Zerstörer was agitated, angry, or generally had heightened awareness, his eyes would glow green.'"),
(99,"Riesen-Ratte","'It is is a bunch of Reinigen joined together in the Erklarend.  Riesen-Ratte appear to lack the intellect of the individual Reinigen and behaves more like a wild animal, displaying no clear signs of intelligence. It holds a hatred for anyone who has attacked or killed one of the individual Reinigen. Due to their heavy reliance on their sense of smell, they are vulnerable to being lured into traps with some type of bait, typically the people they are trying to kill.'"),
(100,"Zerstörer","'A devil-like being from the Mirror Dimension.  Zerstörer had a very intimidating presence and could be quite deliberate in his movements. Prophecies described the beast as a devil, such as Satan, which was to come for earth and seek out a Shaphat to take as his child bride and have a hundred children with. In the Mirror Dimension, Wesen of all species and humans greatly feared Zerstörer, while, in contrast, it seemed as though Zerstörer feared nothing, including Grimms, which he referred to as Dēcapitāre. (\"Where the Wild Things Were\")'"),
(101,"Abartige Aasfresser","'A hyena-like Wesen.  This sadistic scavenger prides himself on recklessness, danger, and bloodshed.  It has bone crushing teeth and a heightened sense of smell, but their eyesight isn't the greatest.'"),
(102,"Abath","'A unicorn-like Wesen.  The horn of the Abath is his primary weapon and is used to impale small children, which it then eats. Much like the tusk of an elephant or horn of a Rhino, it appears to be part of the skull.  I highly suspect that the Abath can see in the dark. His movements are primarily nocturnal and deep within the forest where the sun barely reaches, even in the daylight.  The nose of the Abath is elongated like that of a horse, with large nostrils and overlapping upper lip.'"),
(103,"Ak-Moo-Alii","'A shark-like Wesen.  They are prone to a berserker blood-rage that makes them nearly unstoppable and are known for being one of the fiercest predators in the Wesen world. However, their blood frenzy also is a weakness if exploited properly by a Grimm, as they stop thinking logically. According to a Grimm diary entry, they were viewed as warriors who lived by the oaths or doctrines of the tribes they lived with and protected, serving as a kind of \"warrior's code,\" or code of honor.'"),
(104,"Amarok","'A yeti-like Wesen.  As I crossed the frozen tundra with my guide Akiak en route to Nordvågen, he told me about the Wesen I was looking for, describing it as a human-like creature his people called an Amarok, fur-covered, whose breath he swore could chill its victims to death.'"),
(105,"Ammit","'A chimera-like Wesen.  Traditionally, the Ammit is depicted in art as having the head of a Nile crocodile, the front parts of a lion, and the hind parts of a hippopotamus. Many ancient Egyptian gods that were worshipped were Wesen, including the Ammit, which was commonly depicted as an animal-like creature on tomb walls.'"),
(106,"Augapfel-Aushacken","'A bird-like Wesen that pecks its victim\'s eyes out. This Wesen is highly feared by Blutbaden.'"),
(107,"Bastet","' It has not been revealed whether the Wesen is cat-like or lion-like. During the Ancient Egyptian Empire, Bastet were worshiped as the goddess of cats, the home, fire, joy, dance, music, and love.'"),
(108,"Bhari Kadama","'An elephant-like Wesen.  Bhari Kadama are normally very peaceful and gentle creatures, but if forced to take action or engage in a fight, their size and weight make them very formidable. The way they can throw their weight around has given them the reputation of being an unmovable Wesen.'"),
(109,"Curupira","'A mythological fairy from Brazilian Folklore that dwells in the forest. They ride collared peccary (musk pig) and dislike people who hunt animals. Not much is known about this Wesen\'s behavior, but, based on Rosalee\'s and Monroe\'s comments, it appears to not take kindly at all to poachers or those who disrespect nature, as they have a natural desire to protect the natural environment that they live in.'"),
(110,"Empousai","'A chimera-like Wesen.  Several Wesen were worshipped in Ancient Greece, with the Empousai once considered to be a demigoddess in Greek mythology.  When woged, an Empousai, as traditionally depicted in Ancient Greek art, has hair of fire, one leg of a donkey, and one brass prosthetic leg.'"),
(111,"Faeteo fatalis","'A skunk-like Wesen.  They appear to emit a noxious odor upon facing danger.'"),
(112,"Fétide Taillander","'A foul-smelling Wesen.  Blutbaden can smell them from miles away and fear the Wesen that produce this stench.'"),
(113,"Fossegrim","'A frog-like Wesen.  Fossegrims are known for living in waterfalls and playing the fiddle. They are willing to teach others to play once they gain their trust.  They also lure victims to the water with their music; women, especially pregnant are the most at risk.'"),
(114,"Gefrierengeber","'A type of Wesen capable of enduring the harsh conditions of the North Pole. Santa Claus is a notable Gefrierengeber.'"),

(118,"Leshy","'Not much is known about this Wesen\'s behavior, but, based on Rosalee\'s and Monroe\'s comments, it appears to not take kindly at all to those who disrespect nature, as they have a natural desire to protect the natural environment live in. In general, they are very protective over their territory. They are known to be from Russia and are best characterized as \"forest Wesen,\" as Monroe put it.'"),
(119,"Lob Hombre","'A wolf-like Wesen.'"),
(120,"Mordstier","'A bull-like Wesen.  Mordstiers live in groups or herds led by the largest male. He has full control over the members of his herd until his death, when he is succeeded by the next largest male. Their horns can be very destructive, but Mordstiers tend to be docile until they are threatened.'"),
(121,"Peau de la Mort","'They are known to produce a variety of batrachotoxin, which they secrete through their skin (similarly to the Folterseele), and it is from this that their name originates. Monroe regarded them as being easy to startle, noting that they woge with little provocation.'"),
(122,"Rißfleisch","'A tiger-like Wesen.  Agile and fast with amazing musculature. The Rissfleich takes down its prey by pouncing. Confident in his position in life, the Rissfleich is a formidable entrepreneur, who is unafraid to eliminate his competition.'"),
(123,"Rotznasig Carcaju","'Possibly a wolverine-like Wesen.'"),

(125,"Sangrienta Manos","'The female is feared by Blutbaden. They devour fresh human intestines after making the kill.'"),
(126,"Scheneetmacher","'It is a term used to describe a generally evil Wesen.  Schneetmacher are generally disliked by Wieder Wesen and Grimms alike.  In fact, the contempt of Schneetmacher goes beyond even the Blutbad-Bauerschwein Feud, as Monroe once commented that he would frequent a restaurant run by any type of Wesen except for Schneetmacher, adding that he wouldn\'t even go to a restaurant that served that kind of Wesen.  Marie Kessler did not know enough about Schneetmacher to write about them, and she guessed that it could be a yeti of some sort.'"),
(127,"Schnabeltiermorder","'A platypus-like Wesen.  When they woge, a Shnabeltiermörder develops a broad, duck-like bill and a pair of large, webbed hands that are likely used for swimming.
